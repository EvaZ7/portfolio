<!-- ## Use it

You can use this project to display your github repositories for your users. But you can also use it to sort and fetch data from an API, it has different section that each provide a different way of displaying the data variating from very controlled to putting it all in a list. You can use it also for a more detailed project, or just use the github api layout as a building block for your application. -->

<!-- ## Install it

It is made in vanilla JavaScript with an API. Because of the API you will need to have access to it first. In order to do so:
1. You have to create and account on [API-Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
2. Then you will need the API link, which is: [this link](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/quotes?category=amazing)
3. Add your personal API-key to the link, the key can be found on your personal API-Ninjas account. -->

## Wishlist
